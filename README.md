# CS111CM2Generics
Generics is a large and complex topic, most of which is not covered in our class. (Generics is covered more extensively in 211S.)

For our class, we only need to know enough to use generics in our data types and structures (e.g., lists, stacks, queues, etc.). We'll start learning those data structures next week. First, this week, we'll cover just enough generics to be able to use generics for the semester.

You are not responsible for knowing about bounds, wildcards, or type erasure. You are responsible for being able to use generics inside of a collection class that you write- exactly what you'll do in Project A: Generics.
